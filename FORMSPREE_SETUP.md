# Formspree Setup Guide for Contact Form

This guide will help you set up Formspree to make your contact form functional and send emails to Majidtaseen@gmail.com.

## What is Formspree?

Formspree is a free service that handles form submissions and forwards them to your email. No account creation or complex setup required!

## Step 1: Get Your Formspree Endpoint

1. **Go to [Formspree.io](https://formspree.io/)**
2. **Click "Get Started"**
3. **Enter your email:** `Majidtaseen@gmail.com`
4. **Click "Create Form"**
5. **Copy your form endpoint** (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/xaybzwkd`)

## Step 2: Update Your Code

1. **Open `index.html`**
2. **Find this line:**
```html
<form class="contact-form" id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```
3. **Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual form ID:**
```html
<form class="contact-form" id="contactForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/xaybzwkd" method="POST">
```

4. **Open `script.js`**
5. **Find this line:**
```javascript
const FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT = 'https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID';
```
6. **Replace with your actual endpoint:**
```javascript
const FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT = 'https://formspree.io/f/xaybzwkd';
```

## Step 3: Set Up Email Templates (Optional but Recommended)

For professional-looking emails, you can use the provided templates:

### Option A: Use Formspree's Built-in Templates
The form already includes hidden fields for:
- **Custom subject line** with sender's name
- **Auto-reply to sender** with confirmation message
- **CC to sender** so they get a copy
- **HTML formatting** for better appearance

### Option B: Use Custom HTML Templates
1. **Copy the content** from `email-template.html` and `auto-reply-template.html`
2. **In your Formspree dashboard**, go to "Settings" → "Email Templates"
3. **Paste the HTML** into the appropriate template fields
4. **Save the templates**

The templates include:
- Professional branding with Discord blue theme
- Responsive design for mobile devices
- Clear contact information display
- Next steps for the sender
- Timestamp and submission details

## Step 4: Test Your Form

1. **Open your website**
2. **Fill out the contact form**
3. **Submit the form**
4. **Check your email** (Majidtaseen@gmail.com)
5. **You should receive a confirmation email from Formspree**

## How It Works

1. **User submits form** → Formspree receives the data
2. **Formspree sends emails** → 
   - Professional email to Majidtaseen@gmail.com with all details
   - Auto-reply to sender with confirmation and next steps
