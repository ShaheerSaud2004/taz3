    /* Update other color variables */

.glow-pulse       /* Animated glow pulse */
```

### Form Configuration
To connect the contact form to a backend:

1. Update the `submitForm()` function in `script.js`
2. Replace the simulation with actual API call
3. Handle success/error responses appropriately

```javascript
function submitForm() {
    const formData = new FormData(contactForm);
    
    fetch('your-api-endpoint', {
        method: 'POST',
        body: formData
    })
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        showSuccessMessage();
    })
    .catch(error => {
        showFormError('Failed to send message. Please try again.');
    });
}
```
